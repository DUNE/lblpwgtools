REdiscovery

This is a modified version of discovery.c from the official globes distribution. It adds:

*references to customChi functions
*ability to output chi-squared spectra for particular values of osc parameters
*s22q13 vs dcp confidence regions for the input q13 value and pi/2,0,-pi/2 (with correlations)
*options to change the chi function without modifying the glb file
*changes to the test option; test will cause all minimizations to use glbChiSys instead of the usual projection
*options to print out the final values of systematic nuissance parameters


To build it:
make REdiscovery

To run it:

./REdiscovery -p '0.57964,0.160875277,0.785398,0,0.000079,0.0024' -s0.04 -a0.1 -d0.02 -T0.1 --Resolution=1,30 --Xrange=-0.793095,-0.793095 exp_la_nu_v3.glb exp_la_anu_v3.glb outputFile
