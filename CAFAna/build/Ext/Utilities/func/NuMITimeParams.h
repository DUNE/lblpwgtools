  // NB: if you are using files for which CalHit was run in a release from

  // bug that used to be present in the timing, fixed on this date, and the
  // workaround removed from this file.

  /*
    These cuts are for the Far Detector only.

    Events in the time window when the beam is expected to arrive (plus a small
    amount of padding) go into the analysis. Events outside of these windows
    (plus some extra padding), and also away from the starts and ends of the
    spill are the "timing sideband". These can be used to derive the expected
    cosmic background count in the spill windows. Count events in the sideband
    and then multiply by a scale factor to account for the different livetimes
    (defined as a Var at the bottom of this file, to be passed in the "wei"
    field of the Spectrum).

    A complication: before the shutdown there were problems with the timing
    system, which led to the beam sometimes appearing to be 64us late. We don't
    know exactly when this was and wasn't the case, so we open a second timing
    window, only in this time period, and hence split the sideband into three
    parts. These cuts are supposed to make this completely transparent to
    users.

    The diagram below may or may not help to clarify matters:
